# CustomerAcceptance
The goal of the project is to provide analytics to find if a customer would accept a coupon 
Here is the link for the Jupyter notebook.  https://github.com/bvinodkar/CustomerAcceptance/blob/main/CouponsProject.ipynb
The findings are :
Compare the acceptance rate between those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month to those who went more.
      Findings :  **# the above plot clearly states that people who goto bar more than 3 times a month have a higher chance of accepting the bar coupons **
Compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others. Is there a difference?
      Findings : ***Here it explains that people who are of age 25 and above and who goto bar more than once a month have a higher percentage chance of accepting the coupons ***
Use the same process to compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry.
      Findings :  ***Here it explains that people who goto bar multiple times a month and who do not have kids and in some special professions have higher chance of accepting the coupon ***

go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed OR
go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 OR
go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.
       Findings :  ***Based on the analysis, it is very evident that Target group customers have a higher chance of accepting the coupon ***
